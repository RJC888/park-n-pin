## Phase 3: Swipeable Photo Bottom Sheet (Completed - October 2025)
**Goal:** Modern bottom sheet UI for photo display that maximizes map visibility

**Features Added:**
- Swipeable bottom sheet with 3 states: hidden, collapsed (~60px), expanded (384px)
- Touch gesture support: swipe up to expand, swipe down to collapse
- Tap-to-toggle functionality on collapsed sheet
- Smooth CSS transitions (300ms ease-out)
- Auto-show when photo exists, auto-hide when no photo
- Distance to car displayed in both collapsed and expanded states
- Clear parking button integrated into expanded view

**Files Changed:** `src/App.js`

**New Imports (Line 2):**
- Added `ChevronUp` and `ChevronDown` icons from lucide-react

**New State Variables (Lines 47-49):**
- `sheetState` - Controls sheet visibility ('hidden', 'collapsed', 'expanded')
- `touchStart` - Tracks touch gesture start position
- `touchEnd` - Tracks touch gesture end position

**New Refs (Line 57):**
- `sheetRef` - Reference to bottom sheet DOM element

**New useEffect Hook (Lines 186-193):**
- Automatically manages sheet state based on photo existence
- Shows collapsed when photo exists, hides when no photo

**New Touch Handler Functions (Lines 448-479):**
- `handleTouchStart()` - Captures initial touch position
- `handleTouchMove()` - Tracks swipe movement
- `handleTouchEnd()` - Detects swipe direction and updates state (>50px threshold)
- `toggleSheet()` - Handles tap-to-toggle between collapsed/expanded

**New UI Components (Lines 541-618):**
- Bottom sheet container with dynamic height based on state
- Drag handle indicator (gray bar at top)
- Collapsed view: Small photo thumbnail (48x48px), distance info, chevron up icon
- Expanded view: Full photo display, distance info, clear button, chevron down icon
- Border-radius styling (20px) for modern appearance
- Z-index: 50 (ensures sheet appears above map but below dialogs)

**Updated UI Logic (Lines 525-538):**
- Old parking info card only shows when parking exists but NO photo
- Bottom sheet takes over when photo is present

**Design Specifications:**
- Collapsed height: 80px (20px handle + 60px content)
- Expanded height: 384px (full photo view)
- Photo thumbnail in collapsed: 48x48px with 2px red border
- Swipe threshold: 50px minimum distance
- Transition: 300ms ease-out animation
- Color theme: Red accents matching parking pin branding

**Status:** ✅ Deployed (awaiting live testing)
